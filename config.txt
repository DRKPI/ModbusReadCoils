Configuration information
If the com port is ever moved or changed on the computer then it needs to be updated here as well.
The baud rate in the config file and on the Turbidity device must match, please check both locations to verify.
The time interval is for how often you want to grab a turbidity reading from device. This can be from 1 min to 60 min.
